The recent progress in our society is giving third gender legal rights. Our society has accepted them as third gender but our languages fialed to include them. Gender identities apart from masculine and feminine come in purview of non-binary gender. It includes transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual. In this category, transgenders go through struggle of identity crisis more than other non-binary gender. Lesbian, gay and bisexual get a definable identity and their physical appearance is also widely accepted but transgenders’ physical construction and sexual orientation often put them in struggle for identity. This struggle aggravates when lexical and syntactical scarcity of language leads to failure of defining them. Words make the world for whom there are definable terms but this epigram does not define the world of transgenders due to lack of language property. Language defines many aspects as time, number and gender. English language has almost completely lost grammatical gender of the nouns in due course of language reform, but a few words are still in use with distinct male-female forms. Consider “steward – stewardess”, “waiter-waitress”, “god-goddess”, but it still has gender-specific pronouns. Hindi has grammatical gender in noun, adjectives and in verbs. The careful study of languages defines that there are only three genders widely accepted in the languages masculine, feminine, and neutral. In that case, if third gender needs to tell his/her/its story, it has to take up identity of any one of these genders. We do not find any grammatical gender space for the third gender. No grammar book prescribes pronouns or gender inflections for the third genders. It excludes them mainstream discourse. In our general conversation, people often fumble to get the right pronoun to define the third gender. \r\nThis paper aims to highlight failure of language in describing transgenders as third gender. Lack of grammatical gender and inflections limit their identity either to masculine or feminine. If we analyze roles of transgenders in our society, we find that they do not perform any one the stereotypical roles which are performed by masculine or feminine genders. They are neither ‘baby-bearing mothers’, nor ‘bread-winning fathers’. They are neither ‘he’ nor ‘she’, nor inanimate ‘it’. In that case, expressing their own feelings, their roles, and their story without attaching to either of widely accepted gender is struggle for them. \r\nThis paper will provide some syntactic and lexical data to put forward their struggle in lack of language property.  This paper appeals language experts and researchers to propose new lexical items and grammatical inflections for the third gender.\r\nKeywords: language failure, non-binary gender, grammatical gender, identity,', 'Dr. Jaya Verma\r\nAssistant Professor of English\r\nCVR College of Engineering, Hyderabad.\r\nJayaverma007@gmail.com', NULL, NULL, '2019-10-03 12:14:05', '2019-10-03 12:14:05'),

Previously these were transferred to children through the family tree and social organisations and ultimately there was a behavioural change in the personality of the individual. Now-a-days children are exposed to different social media irrelevant to their age and needs. Moreover unscientific handling of electronic gadgets is making children acquire information which is unnecessary and inadept to their age and needs. Since classroom is the platform to shape the personality of the child and how can an English classroom become resourceful to cultivate and inculcate values in learners using various pedagogical tools.\r\nThus, an English classroom can become productive not only to learn language but also to foster values. There are various agencies of education both government and non-government that work for the cause of education. It is usually observed that learners in government schools usually hail from poor socio-economic background, they cannot be overlooked since it is our social responsibility.\r\nLearners’ participation in performance arts could be a handy tool to learn values and acquire language. Learners acquire values when they.\r\nPractically practice than what they see, watch or visualize. Performance arts like skits, role-plays, dramatisation, plays, story-telling should find a large or wide scope in the teaching learning process. Strategies using advanced technology, audio-visual aids and teaching learning materials could be ultimate and idealistic solutions to bring about desired behavioural change in the learners.

To have an example of this, Singapore has made radical changes in its teacher’s professional development of language teachers by integrating it to AEC (2009) and has invested heavily in teacher’s development. In 2011, they have established English Language Institute to provide professional development activities.1 According, exploring teacher’s perception could be a significant endeavor as teachers beliefs impact their classroom practice, thereby, impacting students learning. This study aims not to compare different language teachers but will shed light on some important aspects of the language teacher development, especially, English language teacher.\r\n	According to Mohmmadi and Moradi, the field of English Language Teaching is subject to rapid changes and professional development can contribute to the effectives of teachers by providing continuous individual and collective improvement that is necessary to adequately address the heighten expectation for improving students learning outcomes.	Walter and Briggs have identified seven aspects of professional development and have succeed in putting teachers profession different,2 what my study expects to think beyond that because teachers have been upgrading themselves by following these aspects. Carry Braniff in his study has observed students, engaged in doing their assignments throughout the day and these classrooms have no personality and students reminded him of zombies.3\r\n	In my area where I teach has no difference consequently, it effects on my personality. The aspects that I want to discuss in my study are Principles, Movements, Time for classroom transitions, Exploration, Self-analysis, Techniques of teaching, Integration of ICT, and Self-observation. I will discuss how principles can make things new and allow us to compare with what we usually do, and that makes one to see teaching differently. The aspect of self-analysis and self-observation has their own importance for a teacher to develop.

Consequently, English had massive impact on the manner vernacular education was conceptualised, processed and presented. We argue that the widespread presence of bilingual education in India can be seen as the reason and consequence of colonial/vernacular modernity that had multidimensional and multiple expressions.

In my school,  Many students are from rural background. Hence  they don’t have access to  English language outside the school. When I thought about giving exposure to students’ speaking skill, anidea of forming a club struck  my mind. Accordingly the things are planned and being executed. Being the convener of the club, I am observing the changes related with attitude, courage,  confidence and  competency in  my learners. I intend to put in sincere efforts to do away with fear factor. Through club activities,  total twenty [20] learners from each class are getting  opportunities  to build up confidence and speak English on a big platform.Thus near about two hundred [200] learners would have  active participatory role in a variety of club activities.

It is mainly focused with respect to the tribal students learning ability of English language which was observed specially in case of the students of Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, who successfully completed a two year English course under the English Access Micro scholarship Program, organized by RELO, New Delhi sponsored by “United States Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs”.  \r\n\r\nPurpose\r\nThe purpose of this paper is to imply the role of “Motivation” and how it helps in developing a learner’s zeal to learn.

This implies the important role of teachers acting as a facilitators and counselors whose motivated the students by instilling confidence in them enabling them to learn the global language ‘English’. \r\n  \r\nThe following methods were adopted in teaching English language to the tribal students of “English Access Micro Scholarship Program”: \r\n\r\nSuggestopedia- This theory is intended to offer learners various choices, which in turn helps them become more responsible for their learning. It’s essential that all learners feel equally comfortable and confident. \r\n \r\nTotal Physical Response (TPR)- is an approach that follows the idea of ‘learning by doing’. \r\n\r\nCommunicative Language Teaching (CLT)- This approach helps learners communicate more effectively and correctly in realistic situations. \r\n\r\nThe Silent Way- This approach emphasizes on learner autonomy. The teacher acts merely as facilitator trying to encourage students to be more active in their learning. \r\n\r\nCommunity Language Learning- This approach emphasizes on the relationship and bond between the student and teacher. A lot of the L1(mother tongue) is used for translation purposes in teaching English as a Second Language.\r\n\r\nTask Based Language Learning- The main aim of this approach is task completion. Usually, relevant and interesting tasks are set by teacher and students are expected to draw on their pre-existing knowledge of English to complete the task. \r\n\r\nThe Lexical Approach- This approach in teaching focuses on vocabulary acquisition and teaching lexical chunks in order of their frequency and use. A great emphasis is on authentic materials and realistic scenarios for more valuable learning. \r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nThe results after completion of the course was astonishing.

The conclusions suggest that introducing vocabulary in terms of frames and choosing the appropriate level of categorization depending on the proficiency level can lead to a better comprehension and retention, consequently, an easier entrenchment of specific lexicon in the long-term memory than using traditional methods.

Many international manufacturing industries increasingly recognize the need for in-service programmes to train the employees in communicative competencies of English. Thus the attainment of competencies has become an integral component of individual, organizational and national strategies. Hence, there is a necessity to identify workplace communicative competencies required for the effective functioning of the workplace.', 'Dr.T.

Not teaching any course at schools in the dominant area is to remain this language under-privilege for its native speakers. Unrest policy is in another factor that affected Shughni language because in the unpredicted situation it would be difficult to expand and maintain the language. At the same time, there were not any available sources for both reading and writing in this language and its speakers can use it only in the medium of communication. Finally, considering all the challenges to which this language has faced are known to its speakers and they have caused to remain it as an oral language.\r\nKey words: losing words, instruction, non-existing material,   and challenges.', 'i am Mirza Mohammad from Afghanistan.

Without gaining the ability of listening effectively, one can’t be master in language learning. If listening is disturbed then communication breaks and the provided message is not acquired.

TPR is teaching method developed by professorJames Asher. This method is best example of comprehension approach. Out of the four skills, speaking is usually the poorest among the students of learning English in China. This results from lack of speaking practice  but students, especially Chinese students tend to be reluctant to speak English. It is important for teachers to encourage and motivate them to speak in English. During the years of my teaching English to Chinese students, I have tried to build language speaking environment, adopted various ways and encouraged students to speak English. In the beginning, they made lots of grammatical errors later on they made lot of progress in speaking English.\r\n materials they focused on my simple commands, like “stand up,” “sit,” “raise your left hands” and so on. Secondly, I created a TPR lessons which was fun, exciting, stress-free and informative.\r\nA good environment helps the students to speak actively and correctly. I tried to ease my students and remove their nervousness, fear and anxiety with encouraging words. Moreover,  I tried these ways to build a free and lighted-hearted environment.\r\n*My findings* - After using TPR it reduced student inhibitions and lowered stress.\r\nStudents paid more attention to me.\r\nIt injected excitement and fun into the classroom and to every word I spoke.

The industry expects the engineering graduates to demonstrate a set of generic skills like effective communication, Inter personal skills, Personal presentation skills, Technical knowledge, Leadership skills, Self-assessment & Goal setting etc. To develop these skills, engineering students are usually trained in the language lab.  The language lab in engineering colleges is set to meet the challenges of the ever-changing needs of the world, in terms of acquiring language skills. Language labs are used, usually, by the first year and the final year engineering students once or twice a week for one or two semesters. \r\nTo make labs cost effective and accessible to students, the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) has initiated the Virtual Labs Project to develop online interactive media to support students in learning difficult concepts in various domains. A virtual lab can be a set of simulations put together (flash-based demos, applets or animations). Students get the opportunity to operate various parameters of the simulation and witness the results. There is only one Virtual lab available in India for improving English communication skills, developed by IIT Guwahati. This paper presents the results of the study conducted to analyse the impact of the Virtual lab on comprehension and comprehensibility among students of an engineering college in Warangal. \r\nThe findings of the study reveal that majority of the students are unaware of the availability of a virtual lab on English Communication Skills.
